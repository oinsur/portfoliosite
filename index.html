                        <p><span>About Me</span>I am a web designer and developer based in El Paso, TX, who creates beautiful and functional websites that meet your specific needs. From the initial idea to the final product, I carefully design and develop every part of your site to engage your audience and achieve results. Your business is unique, and your website should show that. I provide custom web design and development that matches your brand and goals. Whether you need a basic information site or something more robust, I will create a solution that goes beyond your expectations. Today, it's important to have a website that works well on all devices. I build sites that look great and work perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops, giving your visitors the best experience. My designs are not only aesthetically pleasing but also easy to use and navigate.</p>

                                This phase includes comprehensive research to understand your brand & audience, creating wire-frames to map out the structure, and prototype sketches to visualize the design.

                                In this phase, I will bring your ideas to life by creating detailed design layouts and interactive elements using Figma. This before development begins.

                                In this phase, I turn the design into a fully functional website by writing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to build the site. I will make sure that every element is implemented correctly.

                                In this phase, I ensure your website performs seamlessly across all devices. This involves rigorous testing to identify and fix any issues, guaranteeing a smooth and responsive user experience.
